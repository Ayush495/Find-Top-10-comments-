# Explanation of solution
Firstly the url is read and then for finding top 10 comments data-frame is sorted on the basis of points.
Once the comments are selected then top 10 keywords are founf using bag of words,TF-IDF,word_tokenize and finding nouns in them.
After that I took intersection of words obtained from all of the three methods.and those are the final words.
Kindly suggest changes if needed.
